# Can I submit my form using websockets?
  
Yes. `redux-form` has built-in support for managing `submitting` state and errors using promises,
but you can easily replicate its behavior using any other asynchronous paradigm. All you need do
is to dispatch the `START_SUBMIT` and `STOP_SUBMIT` actions yourself using the exported
[Action Creators](#/api/action-creators).

```javascript
import {startSubmit, stopSubmit} from 'redux-form';

function submitForm(data, dispatch) {
  // tell redux-form that the submission has started
  dispatch(startSubmit('myFormName'));
  
  channels.methods.push('submit:myFormName', {data})
    receive('ok', () => {
      // tell redux-form that the submission has stopped
      dispatch(stopSubmit('myFormName'));
      // ^ not necessary if you are redirecting or doing something
      //   else that will result in the form state being destroyed
    })
    .receive('error', response => {
      const {errors} = response;
      // tell redux-form that the submission has stopped with errors
      dispatch(stopSubmit('myFormName', errors));
    });
}
```

The `submitForm` function can then be passed either as an `onSubmit` prop to your decorated form
or as a parameter to `handleSubmit()` inside your form component. For more on this, look at
[the `handleSubmit()` docs](#/api/props).
