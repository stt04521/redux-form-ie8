# Does `redux-form` work with React Native?
  
Yes, it does.

#### If your are using all `react-native@18+`, `redux@4+` and `npm@3+`

Just import it as usual:

```javascript
import {reduxForm} from 'redux-form';
```

#### Else

All you have to do is use:

```javascript
import {reduxForm} from 'redux-form/native';
```
instead of
```javascript
import {reduxForm} from 'redux-form';
```

#### Note:

`react-redux/native` is deprecated in `react-redux@4+`, it only appears in `react-redux@3`
